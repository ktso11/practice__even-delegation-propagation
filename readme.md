A little game I created to explore Jquery on my own time. Inspired by turn based RPG, which relies heavily on text, and minimal UI.

This is for comic relief. Please don't take it too seriously.

- https://ktso11.github.io/life-RPG
- Click on "Find Enemy" start
- User can choose to attack or use magic on the enemy
- Enemy will return attack in 2 seconds
- Game is over when the user or the enemy is defeated.
